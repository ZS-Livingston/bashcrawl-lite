There's a pile of old **rags**.  They are old and worn with
age, and probably fell off of some poor adventurer.

printf "Do you want to take the rags? y/n  "

read -r response

if [[ $response =~ ^[Yy].* ]]; then
    cat <<EOF
As you take the rags from the floor, you find a salted fish,
probably from the rations of the former owner of these rags.
Prefix these items to your inventory:

export inventory=rags,fish,\$inventory

Remember, you can check your inventory"

echo \$inventory
