no_crystal() {
    cat <<EOF
You sense that the glass shards are searching for something.
Whatever it is, you cannot provide it now.

Walk with care.

        cat <<EOF
You place the ice crystal among the shards of glass.  The
sword in your hands becomes cold.  You feel the power of
1000 blizzards coursing through it.
