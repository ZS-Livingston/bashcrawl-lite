# Welcome!

This is a game designed to teach you the basics of using a POSIX (Linux, BSD, UNIX) terminal.

## How to Start Playing

To begin your adventure, first access a terminal on your machine. You can do this by SSH-ing (Secure Shell) into a machine or by using any other method to access a command-line interface.

Once you are in the terminal, use the `cd` command to change directories to the location where you have saved the game. For example:

```
cd ~/bashcrawl-lite/entrance
```

Replace '/path/to/destination' with the relative (starts with tilde '~') or absolute (starts with slash '/') path to your desired destination.

Replace `~/bashcrawl-lite/entrance` with the actual path to the 'entrance' directory in the bashcrawl game folder. This path varies depending on where you've saved or extracted the game files.

After you've navigated to the 'entrance' directory, it's time to start your game. Enter the following command:

```
$ cat scroll
```

This action will display the contents of the 'scroll' file, marking the beginning of your game. From here, follow the instructions and explore the game.

At this point, you are in the game.

Happy adventuring, and may the gods be in your favor!
